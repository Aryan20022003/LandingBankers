#LandingBankers

Welcome to the Landing Page of the Imaginary Banking App! This landing page was designed to showcase the features of our banking app and provide a glimpse of what users can expect.

As for the features I've implemented, I focused on making the navigation bar dynamic, implementing lazy loading and smooth scrolling using the Intersection API, adding the cookie tag to the HTML document, and creating a horizontal review section by manipulating CSS.

In the process of building this landing page, I learned a lot about core JavaScript logic, including bubbling and capturing event listening. I also gained experience in various ways to manipulate and add HTML code to the document, as well as a detailed understanding of scoping and DOM traversal.

One of the key concepts I learned and implemented in this project is the Intersection API, which allowed me to create smooth scrolling and lazy loading effects. Additionally, I gained experience in using event listening and effect methods to improve user interactions.

It's worth noting that while the CSS was provided by my mentor, I implemented the majority of the JavaScript functionality. I have a detailed understanding of how the HTML and CSS work together to create a great user experience.

Thank you for visiting the Landing Page of the Imaginary Banking App. Please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for future updates.
